## Overview
This project was the first step I took using DOM (Document Object Model), which allowed me to manipulate HTML and CSS using JavaScript. In this project, I made an interactive user review section of a webpage clickable, and able to trigger certain actions on clicking.

### What I learned
I learned how to use, call and assign variables and constants based on whatever I needed to work on at the time.

I learned how to toggle an active state for an element on or off, or to allow it to be applied to others.

I learnt that `=>` can be used alternatively to call void functions instead of taking a longer approach to calling the function.

I still saw shege because I was trying so hard to perfect the code, but thank God for progress.
